How to use GitHub, First try.

I use GitHub as a Beginner and I'd think that it would be interessting to use it for my documentation.
At first I was Log In into GitHub, I didn't know what it is about, but have read often about it on websites like reddit and a few sites about Kali Linux.
I use Kali for the first time and also be the first time deeper in the IT. I learn it by myself with the worst English, cause I didn't care about it in my
schooltime. 

Now I want to learn IT and English and I hope it is the beginning from something new.
I hope you are not to hard to me when something goes wrong or the text is read a little bit nonenglish. :D
I have to find out know how i can make a GitHub-site and search for the settings.

Ehen someone want to help your Welcome!
